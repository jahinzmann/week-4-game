<!--Time to make an RPG

Film Noir/Detective Theme maybe with some sci-fi elements.

Crystal game model? Guess numbers? 
Any way to package that in an interesting context like that described above?

How about a hacking theme? 
Steal the Death Star plans from Scarif... 
'hack' into the imperial computer by guessing the correct series of numbers to enter the passcode!

Use the JPEG of the Scarif base 

now, the game mechanics:

Have some buttons (search for a Star Wars theme)... Have each represent a certain increment

write functions for each button: they should also be variations of the same thing 
increase by X-increment.

Look for buttons on <j-query 

Create a random number generator to create the number the player has to guess.

Should the player know they number they're supposed to guess? Not sure yet...

Once they guess the number, they should get a reward with a new image... 

and that's that.
